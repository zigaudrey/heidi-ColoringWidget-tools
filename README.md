## Story of Heidi's Coloring Widget
Heidi's Coloring Widget (or as I call DA Pixel Maker) is a Flash App created for [the 2010 contest "Show Your Love"] (https://web.archive.org/web/20121114101333/https://heidi.deviantart.com/journal/Show-the-Love-Valentine-s-Day-Contest-214219090).
Though to be made for a Valentine-theme contest, artists use it as a Pixel Art software, even after the end of the contest. Until Flash Reader is no longer available.

## Why these tools were made
After the ZDA-Reconstruction-Tool, I decide to take another file to analyze (and take advantage of) and choose the Flash Cookie for Coloring Widget. It was easy to understand but become a frustration overtime. Another factor is that I won't to lose the Art data value and getting the right color is a pain.
I know these Pixel Art are mean to be one-of-the-kind piece of work but these kind of scripts has to exist, right?
